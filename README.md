# StockPredictorARIMAandProphet

## Project Overview<br>
The stock market is a complex and highly dynamic environment influenced by numerous factors, making accurate stock analysis difficult. However, stock predictors still have values as it can be used to make informed decisions and maximize returns. To reduce risk and increase the accuracy of predictions, the focus will be on stocks with a history of low volatility and variability, often found in ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). <br>


## Project Goal<br>
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for ETFs with low volatility using ARIMA time-series analysis, aiming to forecast stock prices accurately. Success will be measured by metrics such as MAE and RMSE, with a timeline of 1 week for data collection, analysis, and evaluation. This project will showcase advanced machine learning techniques and provide visual comparisons of actual vs. predicted stock prices for informed investment decisions.<br>
